Treehouse project for a Full Stack Conf website using Bootstrap.  Original material: www.teamtreehouse.com

This is a follow along project from Treehouse (www.teamtreehouse.com) which incorporates Bootstrap into an HTML page for a fictional conference called Full Stack Conf.  This is NOT my original work.  All credit goes to the content creators at Treehouse (see the aforementioned link), specifically the Bootstrap 4 Basics course featuring Guil Hernandez.
